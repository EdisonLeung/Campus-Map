# tests pathfinding where a node has 2 paths (with multiple jumps) with the
# same distance

# Create Graph
created graph twoPaths

# Add Nodes
added node a to twoPaths
added node b to twoPaths
added node c to twoPaths
added node d to twoPaths

# Add Edges
added edge AB from a to b in twoPaths
added edge BC from b to c in twoPaths
added edge AD from a to d in twoPaths
added edge DC from d to c in twoPaths

# test pathfinding from a to c
path from a to c:
a to b via AB
b to c via BC
