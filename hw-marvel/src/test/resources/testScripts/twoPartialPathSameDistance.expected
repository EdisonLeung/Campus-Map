# Test pathfinding on a node with 2 paths that have the same distance but the two
# paths also share a same path for part of the traversal. Tests if the least
# lexicographical path is chosen

# Create graph
created graph partialPath

# Add nodes
added node a to partialPath
added node b to partialPath
added node c to partialPath

# Add edges
added edge ABa from a to b in partialPath
added edge ABb from a to b in partialPath
added edge BC from b to c in partialPath

# test pathfinding from a to c
path from a to c:
a to b via ABa
b to c via BC
