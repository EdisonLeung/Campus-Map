# Tests pathfinding for graph with 2 paths, should find the shortest path. There are
# 3 nodes: a, b, and c. Node A will be connected to C directly and via node B.
# Pathfinding should find the shortest route from A to C (A to C directly)

# Create graph
created graph twoPaths

# Add nodes
added node a to twoPaths
added node b to twoPaths
added node c to twoPaths

# Add edges
added edge AB from a to b in twoPaths
added edge BC from b to c in twoPaths
added edge AC from a to c in twoPaths

# pathfinding
path from a to c:
a to c via AC
