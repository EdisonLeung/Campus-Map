# Test pathfinding for a node where there is no path to another node but both nodes
# have children (they are just not related)

# Create graph
CreateGraph noPath

# Add nodes
AddNode noPath a
AddNode noPath b
AddNode noPath c

# Add edges
AddEdge noPath a b ABa
AddEdge noPath a b ABb
AddEdge noPath c a CA
AddEdge noPath c b CB

# pathfinding from a to c
FindPath noPath a c
