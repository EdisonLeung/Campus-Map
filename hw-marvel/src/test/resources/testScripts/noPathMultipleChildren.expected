# Test pathfinding for a node where there is no path to another node but both nodes
# have children (they are just not related)

# Create graph
created graph noPath

# Add nodes
added node a to noPath
added node b to noPath
added node c to noPath

# Add edges
added edge ABa from a to b in noPath
added edge ABb from a to b in noPath
added edge CA from c to a in noPath
added edge CB from c to b in noPath

# pathfinding from a to c
path from a to c:
no path found
