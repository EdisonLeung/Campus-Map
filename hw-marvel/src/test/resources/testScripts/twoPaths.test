# Tests pathfinding for graph with 2 paths, should find the shortest path. There are
# 3 nodes: a, b, and c. Node A will be connected to C directly and via node B.
# Pathfinding should find the shortest route from A to C (A to C directly)

# Create graph
CreateGraph twoPaths

# Add nodes
AddNode twoPaths a
AddNode twoPaths b
AddNode twoPaths c

# Add edges
AddEdge twoPaths a b AB
AddEdge twoPaths b c BC
AddEdge twoPaths a c AC

# pathfinding
