# Tests pathfinding on a node with 2 path options which have the same length.
# Should print the path with the lexicographically least node (if nodes the same, then
# compares the edges

# Create graph
created graph sameDistance

# Add nodes
added node a to sameDistance
added node b to sameDistance

# Add edges
added edge ABa from a to b in sameDistance
added edge ABb from a to b in sameDistance

# test pathfinding from a to b
path from a to b:
a to b via ABa
