# Tests pathfinding on a node that has no edges and thus no path to another node

# Create Graph
created graph noPath

# Add nodes
added node a to noPath
added node b to noPath
added node c to noPath

# Add edges
added edge BA from b to a in noPath
added edge BC from b to c in noPath

# pathfinding from a to c
