# Tests pathfinding where there is no path and the nodes goes in a loop. Purpose of
# the test is to test that the pathfinding will not create an infinite loop

# Create graph
created graph noPathReflexive

# Add nodes
added node a to noPathReflexive
added node b to noPathReflexive
added node c to noPathReflexive

# Add edges
added edge AB from a to b in noPathReflexive
added edge BA from b to a in noPathReflexive

# Pathfinding from a to c
path from a to c:
no path found
