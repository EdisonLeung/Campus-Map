# Test the creation of 2 graphs. One graph will have 2 nodes with an edge, the other
# will only have 1 node

# Create graphs
created graph graphOne
created graph graphTwo

# Add 2 nodes to graphOne
added node a to graphOne
added node b to graphOne

# Add one node to graphTwo
added node a to graphTwo

# Add edge for graphOne
added edge AB from a to b in graphOne

# Print nodes and children of graphs
graphOne contains: a b
the children of a in graphOne are: b(AB)

graphTwo contains: a
