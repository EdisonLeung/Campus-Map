# Test adding 2 edges that point to 2 different nodes

# Create graph
created graph ringBuffer

# Add 2 nodes
added node a to ringBuffer
added node b to ringBuffer

# Add the 2 edges pointing to the different nodes
added edge AB from a to b in ringBuffer
added edge BA from b to a in ringBuffer

# Print the nodes and the children
ringBuffer contains: a b
the children of a in ringBuffer are: b(AB)
the children of b in ringBuffer are: a(BA)
