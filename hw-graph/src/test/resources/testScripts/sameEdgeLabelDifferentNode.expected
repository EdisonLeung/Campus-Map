# Tests adding 2 edges with same label to different nodes

# Create graph
created graph sameEdge

# Add nodes
added node a to sameEdge
added node b to sameEdge

# adds 2 edges with same label but to different nodes
added edge AB from a to b in sameEdge
added edge AB from b to a in sameEdge

# Print nodes and children
sameEdge contains: a b
the children of a in sameEdge are: b(AB)
the children of b in sameEdge are: a(AB)
