# Tests creating a graph with multiple complex nodes and edges. Creates 5 nodes:
# a, b, c, d, and e. Node a will have 4 edges pointing to a, b, c, d. Node b will have
# 1 edge pointing to d. Node c will have 2 edges pointing to b and d. Node d will have
# 1 edge pointing to b. Node e will have 2 edge pointing to itself.
