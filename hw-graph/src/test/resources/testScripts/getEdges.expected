# Tests the getChildren function by adding edges, printing the edges and then
# adding another edge and printing it to see if new edge is printed

# Create graph
created graph getEdge

# Add Nodes
added node a to getEdge
added node b to getEdge

# Add edge
added edge AB from a to b in getEdge

# Print children
the children of a in getEdge are: b(AB)

# Add another edge
added edge AA from a to a in getEdge

# Print children
the children of a in getEdge are: a(AA) b(AB)
