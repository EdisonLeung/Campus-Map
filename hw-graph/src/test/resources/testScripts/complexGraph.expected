# Tests creating a graph with multiple complex nodes and edges. Creates 5 nodes:
# a, b, c, d, and e. Node a will have 4 edges pointing to a, b, c, d. Node b will have
# 1 edge pointing to d. Node c will have 2 edges pointing to b and d. Node d will have
# 1 edge pointing to b. Node e will have 2 edge pointing to itself.

# Create graph
created graph complexGraph

# Add nodes
added node a to complexGraph
added node b to complexGraph
added node c to complexGraph
added node d to complexGraph
added node e to complexGraph

# Add edges
added edge AA from a to a in complexGraph
added edge AB from a to b in complexGraph
added edge AC from a to c in complexGraph
added edge AD from a to d in complexGraph
added edge BD from b to d in complexGraph
added edge CB from c to b in complexGraph
added edge CD from c to d in complexGraph
added edge DB from d to b in complexGraph
added edge EE from e to e in complexGraph
added edge EE1 from e to e in complexGraph
