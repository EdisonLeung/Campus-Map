# Create graph
created graph selfDestChildNode

# Add 2 nodes
added node a to selfDestChildNode
added node b to selfDestChildNode

# Add one edge that references the node it comes from
added edge AA from a to a in selfDestChildNode

# Add second edge that references the other node
added edge AB from a to b in selfDestChildNode

# Print the nodes and the children
selfDestChildNode contains: a b
the children of a in selfDestChildNode are: a(AA) b(AB)
