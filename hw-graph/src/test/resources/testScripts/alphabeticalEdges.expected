# Test if ListChildren will print the children with edges in alphabetical order
# by adding 3 edges that point to a node in reverse alphabetical order

# Create graph
created graph alphabeticEdge

# Add 2 Nodes
added node a to alphabeticEdge
added node b to alphabeticEdge

# Add edges from a to b in reverse alphabetical order
added edge AC from a to b in alphabeticEdge
added edge AB from a to b in alphabeticEdge
added edge AA from a to b in alphabeticEdge

# Print nodes and children
alphabeticEdge contains: a b
the children of a in alphabeticEdge are: b(AA) b(AB) b(AC)
