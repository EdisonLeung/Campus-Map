# Tests pathfinding for path with least cost but not least jumps

# Create Graph
created graph minPath

# Add nodes
added node a to minPath
added node b to minPath
added node c to minPath

# Add edges
added edge 5.000 from a to b in minPath
added edge 5.000 from b to c in minPath
added edge 20.000 from a to c in minPath

# test pathfinding
path from a to c:
a to b with weight 5.000
b to c with weight 5.000
total cost: 10.000
