# Test pathfinding for node with 2 possible paths but the paths will
# combine. Tests if pathfinding finds the best possible graph based on
# cost

# Create graph
created graph partialPath

# Add nodes
added node a to partialPath
added node b to partialPath
added node c to partialPath

# Add edges
added edge 1.000 from a to b in partialPath
added edge 2.000 from a to b in partialPath
added edge 3.000 from b to c in partialPath

# test pathfinding
path from a to c:
a to b with weight 1.000
b to c with weight 3.000
total cost: 4.000
