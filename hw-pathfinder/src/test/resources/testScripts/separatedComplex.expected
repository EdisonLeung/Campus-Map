# Tests pathfinding on a graph where 2 sets of nodes are isolated
# from each other

# Create Graph
created graph separated

# Add nodes
added node a to separated
added node b to separated
added node c to separated
added node d to separated
added node e to separated
added node f to separated

# Add edges
added edge 10.000 from a to b in separated
added edge 1.000 from a to c in separated
added edge 3.000 from b to a in separated
added edge 4.000 from c to b in separated
added edge 1.000 from d to f in separated
added edge 3.000 from f to e in separated
added edge 2.000 from e to d in separated

# test pathfinding
path from a to b:
a to c with weight 1.000
c to b with weight 4.000
total cost: 5.000

path from b to a:
b to a with weight 3.000
total cost: 3.000

path from c to a:
c to b with weight 4.000
