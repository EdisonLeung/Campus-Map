# Test min pathfinding for a node with 2 paths with 2 jumps. First path
# has lower initial cost but higher overall cost and second path has
# higher initial cost but lower overall cost. Tests if pathfinding will
# choose the second path because it has a lower overall cost

# Create Graph
created graph minPath

# Add Nodes
added node a to minPath
added node b to minPath
added node c to minPath
added node d to minPath

# Add Edge
added edge 1.000 from a to b in minPath
added edge 4.000 from b to c in minPath
added edge 2.000 from a to d in minPath
added edge 1.000 from d to c in minPath

# Test pathfinding
path from a to c:
a to d with weight 2.000
d to c with weight 1.000
total cost: 3.000
