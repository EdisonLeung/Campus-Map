# Tests pathfinding on a path with the lowest cost and least number of
# jumps

# Create Graph
created graph shortestPath

# Add nodes
added node a to shortestPath
added node b to shortestPath
added node c to shortestPath

# Add edges
added edge 5.000 from a to b in shortestPath
added edge 5.000 from b to c in shortestPath
added edge 1.000 from a to c in shortestPath

# test pathfinding
path from a to c:
a to c with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
