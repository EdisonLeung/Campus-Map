# Tests the total cost calculating functionality of pathfinding

# Create Graph
created graph cost

# Add Nodes
added node a to cost
added node b to cost
added node c to cost

# Add Edges
added edge 1.000 from a to b in cost
added edge 1.000 from b to c in cost

# Test Pathfinding
path from a to c:
a to b with weight 1.000
b to c with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000
