# Tests printing out the children to see if it prints the edges
# from least cost to most cost

# Create Graph
created graph listChildren

# Add nodes
added node a to listChildren
added node b to listChildren
added node c to listChildren

# Add edges
added edge 4.000 from a to b in listChildren
added edge 3.000 from a to b in listChildren
added edge 6.000 from a to c in listChildren
added edge 1.000 from a to c in listChildren

# print children
the children of a in listChildren are: b(3.000) b(4.000) c(1.000) c(6.000)
