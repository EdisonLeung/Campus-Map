# Tests pathfinding on node with no path to another node

# Create Graph
created graph noPath

# Add nodes
added node a to noPath
added node b to noPath
added node c to noPath

# Add edges
added edge 5.000 from b to a in noPath
added edge 5.000 from b to c in noPath

# test pathfinding
path from b to a:
b to a with weight 5.000
total cost: 5.000

path from b to c:
b to c with weight 5.000
total cost: 5.000

path from a to b:
no path found

path from a to c:
no path found
