# tests pathfinding where a node has a reflective edge and multiple
# paths to another node

# Create graph
created graph minPath

# Add nodes
added node a to minPath
added node b to minPath
added node c to minPath

# Add edges
added edge 1.000 from a to b in minPath
added edge 3.000 from b to a in minPath
added edge 3.000 from b to c in minPath
added edge 5.000 from a to c in minPath

# test pathfinding
path from a to c:
a to b with weight 1.000
b to c with weight 3.000
total cost: 4.000

path from b to a:
b to a with weight 3.000
total cost: 3.000

path from c to a:
no path found
