# tests pathfinding on a node with children in a reflexive pattern and
# no path. Tests that algorithm will not create infinite loop

# Create Graph
created graph noPath

# add nodes
added node a to noPath
added node b to noPath
added node c to noPath

# add edges
added edge 5.000 from a to b in noPath
added edge 5.000 from b to a in noPath

# test pathfinding
path from a to b:
a to b with weight 5.000
total cost: 5.000

path from a to c:
no path found
