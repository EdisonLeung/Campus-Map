1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test because the code would throw an
Exception when n = 0 whe it should only throw an exception if n was negative. I fixed this by simply
checking if n < 0 instead of n <= 0 so that it would only throw the exception if n was negative.


2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

It never failed the tesBaseCase because it would always return 1 if n < 2. And since FibonacciTest only tested
the cases for when n = 0 and n = 1 and it expected the output to be 1, then the testBaseCase would never fail.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the testInductiveCase because it was subtracting instead of adding and it would return 1 when
n = 2 when it should only return 1 when n <= 1. I fixed the problem by changing the subtraction to an addition
and making the base case check for when n < 2 instead of n <= 2.
